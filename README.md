Limitations
-  Need to focus on fundamentals and keep re-iterating over this prior to moving onto other frameworks. Had a friend I was working with on the other side of the world and time differences when I needed help were also an issue regarding Gulp and Node.JS so went back to using SAAS Live Compiler.
